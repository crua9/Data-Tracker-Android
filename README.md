# Data-Tracker-Android
Tells you when you are getting data while you're on a trip. Also will tell you if you get 3G+ so you know you can watch videos

For example, if you're riding it takes 3G or higher to watch Netflix. You can have the app simply alert you when you get whatever signal type your looking for so you can do what you want.

Another example is if you don't have any data, and you're trying to use your maps. The app may help when you get lost and you need to look at the map or do whatever when you get data.
